# KRYPT
Using Blockchain Technology for transaction of Digital Currency

In this Project our team build and display a modern real world web 3.0 blockchain application.

In this project we are creating a stunning design.

- Connected to blockchain.
- Metamask Pairing.
- Interaction with smart contracts.
- Sending ethereum through the blockchain.
- Writing solidity code.

We are connecting a regular ReactJS application to the blockchain and paired to the etherum wallet using metamask. 

And also we are writing smart contracts on Ethereum network using solidity programming language.

This is a full-fledged web 3.0 application that allows users to transaction through the blockchain. 

Each transaction will then be paired with a gif (gift) and it will be forever stored on the blockcahin.

Follow these steps to run this project:-

1. First we need to download VS Code and nodeJS. Also we are using new technology vite in this project.
2. So We need to install vite for that first we need to change directory to client for that we need to write - (cd client)
3. Then type the (npm init vite@latest) for installing vite then they asking for project name so we simply enter (./) because we are already in project folder.
4. After we need to choose package name (krypt) then select a framework react and select varient is also react.
5. Type (npm install) after selecting a framework.
6. Use (npm run dev) to run this project.

In this project we are using metamask wallet for transaction of ethereum.

We are generating fake ethereum for transaction using this https://faucets.chain.link/ by Goerali Test Network.

Our each transaction will then be paired with a gif for that we are using this https://developers.giphy.com/ for creating api then fetch with our application.
